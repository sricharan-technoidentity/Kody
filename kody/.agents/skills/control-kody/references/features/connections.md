# Connections

Inbound MCP hosts (connected agents). The connected list is a grouped panel with
per-`clientId` revoke. **Add connection** is its own page: the full client wall
from onboarding Step 1 — every named agent, on every device, none folded under
Not listed — then one host's install steps. The MCP URL card covers any other
host that speaks MCP. Also links the Advanced MCP OAuth clients page.

## How to get there

- `/account/connections` — connected list, Add connection button, MCP URL. Does
  not nest the add grid.
- `/account/connections/new` — the agent grid, with a “← back to connections”
  link. Does not wrap the connected list.
- `/account/connections/new/:agent` — install steps for one `McpClientKind`
  (`cursor`, `claude-code`, `chatgpt`, …; `other` is not a page here). Unknown
  agents 404.

Account rail → Connections; Overview keeps a "Manage connections" link.

## Drive it

```bash
node tools/control-kody.ts login
node tools/control-kody.ts request GET /account/connected-agents.json
node tools/control-kody.ts request GET /account/connections/new
node tools/control-kody.ts request GET /account/connections/new/cursor
```

## APIs

- `GET|POST /account/connected-agents.json` (`{ intent: 'revoke', clientId }`)
- `mcpServerUrl` in that payload is empty until the account email is verified
  (same gate as `/onboarding.json`); the page then shows a verify note instead
  of the grid and copy card.
- All three HTML views share that one payload (no refetch between them).

## Gotchas

- Seed users start with no connected agents; connect one from Add connection or
  an MCP host to see the list. Revoke is a double-check button per connection:
  confirm and the in-flight POST stay on that row, so other Revoke controls stay
  clickable. Confirm removes the row immediately; a failed request restores that
  row only.
- Hosts are grouped by display name (logos for known kinds, last-used then
  connected newest-first, best-effort labels). Last used is the revoke signal
  (successful `/mcp` bearer validation). A missing stamp renders as "unknown".
  Connected is grant `createdAt`. That list is not `users.mcp_client_name` and
  not minted MCP OAuth clients (`/account/mcp-oauth-clients`).
- The grid reuses onboarding's `AgentPickerGrid` with `viewport: 'both'` on
  every entry. Every named agent shows on phone and desktop. Already-connected
  hosts keep a Connected mark and stay selectable (same as onboarding Step 3) so
  connect steps can be re-viewed. The connected list offers **View connect
  steps** for known kinds.
- `/account/connections.json` is the sign-in provider (GitHub, Google, …) list
  on Overview, not this page's data.
