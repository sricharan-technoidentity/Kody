  Babysit a PR: iterate with AI reviewers and CI until green, get it ready,
  optionally squash-merge as Kody and watch the deploy, file leftover repo
  papercuts through friction-log/file, then send a Discord summary. Medium risk
  waits for AI reviewer(s) and addresses valid feedback. Use when a pull request
  needs to be shepherded to done.

# Ship PR

## Risk → merge authority

Self-assess; user policy overrides.

**Kent's standing policy (2026-08-08):** auto-ship (squash-merge + verify
deploy) once AI reviewer feedback is addressed and CI is green, unless **high**
risk. High risk still parks ready-for-review unless merge authority was granted
explicitly.

- **Low** — green CI; nits ignorable; squash-merge when policy allows.
- **Medium** — wait for AI reviewer(s); address **valid** feedback (ignore
  insignificant nits / already-fixed / wrong); then merge when policy allows.
- **High** — leave ready-for-review unless the user granted merge authority.

## AI reviewers

Prefer **Cursor Bugbot** (`Cursor Bugbot` check / `cursor[bot]` review
comments). Never comment `bugbot run` or `cursor review` yourself, including via
`gh` or GitHub request as kody-bot. Trigger with `kody:@kentcdodds/bugbot` using
`{ prUrl }` or `{ owner, repo, prNumber }`. Do not pass a GitHub account.

Cloud Agent `gh` cannot post PR review-thread replies (403). Use
`kody:@kentcdodds/github/request` (default `bot` account) to `POST`
`/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies`, or
Cursor `ManagePullRequest` `post_comment` with `in_reply_to`. Do not stall
ship-pr waiting on a `gh api` reply that will never post.

```javascript
import triggerBugbot from 'kody:@kentcdodds/bugbot'

await triggerBugbot({ prUrl })
```

**CodeRabbit:** if it is rate-limited, errored, or otherwise unavailable, **do
not wait** on it for low/medium risk — proceed with Bugbot + CI. Only wait on
CodeRabbit when the change is **high** risk (or the user explicitly asks).

## Loop

1. Mark ready — `kody:@kentcdodds/github/pr/set-review-status`
   `{ prUrl, status: 'ready' }` (or owner/repo/prNumber).
2. Wait for CI — `gh pr checks` (or compose `loop-on-ci` / `fix-ci`). Ignore a
   failure event whose SHA is not the current PR `headRefOid`
   (`gh pr view --json headRefOid`). Checks for an abandoned commit are not a
   red PR; wait on the new head.
3. Fix failures; for **medium+**, wait on AI reviewer(s) (Bugbot first; see
   above for CodeRabbit) and address valid feedback. While the PR is open, also
   fix obvious in-scope low-risk repo friction you are already touching, mention
   the fix, and let CI finish again before merging. Rebase only when actually
   unmergeable. Immediately before merge, recheck tip-of-main mergeability
   (`gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`). If GitHub flipped the PR to
   CONFLICTING after green checks, fetch `origin/main`, rebase once, push, and
   wait for CI again. Recheck mergeability after that recovery CI succeeds and
   before merging. If it is still CONFLICTING after the single rebase, stop and
   report the conflict — do not rebase again, and do not treat “green then
   conflicting” as a surprise dead-end. For **medium+**, also run
   `npm run control-kody -- preview` (or `npm run preview:manual-test`) as the
   seeded user **with data for this change** (`control-kody request` /
   `--request`; do not cat the cookie into curl or Python — see
   [control-kody](../control-kody/SKILL.md) and
   [preview-manual-test](../preview-manual-test/SKILL.md)). Admin-gated states
   (suspension, outbound-email pause, account deletion) cannot be set on the
   public preview seed; local admin plus Workers or unit tests count as
   sufficient evidence. After merge,
   `npm run control-kody -- health --origin https://kody.codes --sha <merge>`.
   After a `main` merge, GitHub may show an all-skipped 🚀 Deploy (production)
   run while ✅ Validate is still in progress (a cancelled prior Validate
   `workflow_run` starts Deploy, and `sha-guard` requires success). Wait for
   Validate success on the merge SHA, then watch the subsequent Deploy run. Do
   not poll production `/health` against the previous SHA from a skipped Deploy.
4. Green + (medium+: valid feedback cleared) → break.
5. Push → repeat.

## Gates ≠ CI

Blocked on soak / parity CHECK / calendar gate → **end the run** and schedule a
wake (`execute` + `workflows.create({ runAt, idempotencyKey })` calling
`createRun`). Don't sleep-poll or code-thrash an intentional time window.
Leftovers that wait on that gate need a GitHub issue (`Cleanup:` title); see
[cleanup-after-migrations](../cleanup-after-migrations/SKILL.md).

Batch related expand steps into fewer PRs when risk posture allows.

## Merge / deploy

When policy + risk allow: squash-merge via `kody:@kentcdodds/github/pr/merge`
`{ prUrl, mergeMethod: 'squash' }`, watch deploy. Useful: `pr/get-checks`,
`request`, `graphql` on the same package.

## Leftover friction

After the merge or park decision (or when ending the run), and before the
Discord summary, scan the session for leftover out-of-scope papercuts this PR
did not fix. Judge filing and in-scope fixes by the principles in the
[friction log](../../../docs/contributing/friction-log.md): durable recurring
pain with a clear owner; platform vs package routing; prefer one clear contract
over aliases, compat layers, or owner-hardcoded special-cases. Do not push more
commits onto a merged PR. In-scope fixes belong in the loop above, while the PR
is open.

File leftovers that meet the bar with `kody:@kentcdodds/friction-log/file` via
Kody MCP `execute`. Always pass required
`target: { host: 'github' | 'kody', repo: string }` plus `items` (one papercut
each). Include `whatHappened`, `whatYouWanted`, `howToReproduce`, and `cost`
when known. Platform leftovers use
`{ host: 'github', repo: 'kentcdodds/kody' }`. Package-owned leftovers use
`host: 'kody'` (wakes Patch). Omit secrets. If nothing meets the bar, skip the
call or pass empty `items`. Do not invent papercuts. Do not use
`gh issue create` or a raw GitHub issue POST.

Policy: [friction log](../../../docs/contributing/friction-log.md). Outside this
pass: [file-friction](../file-friction/SKILL.md).

```javascript
import fileFriction from 'kody:@kentcdodds/friction-log/file'

export default async function main() {
	return fileFriction({
		target: { host: 'github', repo: 'kentcdodds/kody' },
		items: [
			{
				title: 'what hurt',
				whatHappened: '...',
				whatYouWanted: '...',
				howToReproduce: '...',
				cost: '...',
			},
		],
	})
}
```

## Done → Discord

Always summarize (merged or not) via `kody:@kentcdodds/discord/send-shipped-pr`.
That export formats kind ship-pr, fetches Cursor token cost from the usage API,
and includes the model you pass. Never invent a dollar figure or a model id.
When the work deployed user-visible pages, put clickable links to those pages in
`extras` (see below) so Kent can open the live result from Discord.

**title (required):** a human headline of the change itself so the Discord post
is glanceable. Example: `OpenAPI spec fetches now count against daily quota`. Do
**not** use `ship owner/repo#N` as the title — repo, PR, and agent already
appear as links.

**difficulty (required):** `'Easy' | 'Medium' | 'Hard'`. Always pass it.
Distinct from Risk (merge authority). Easy = small/localized; Medium = several
files or real behavior change; Hard = architecture, migrations, subtle
correctness, or wide blast radius. The Discord export renders this on its own
line.

**agentId (required):**

- In a Cursor Cloud Agent VM, read it from the metadata socket:
  `curl -fsS --unix-socket "${CURSOR_AGENT_SOCKET:-/run/cursor/api.sock}" http://cursor-agent/v1/meta-data/agent/id`
- Otherwise pass the `bc-` id from the agent URL you were launched as
  (`https://cursor.com/agents/{id}`).

**model (deterministic — never infer):**

- In a Cursor Cloud Agent VM, read the model that **served this turn** from the
  metadata socket (not a guess from writing style):
  `curl -fsS --unix-socket "${CURSOR_AGENT_SOCKET:-/run/cursor/api.sock}" http://cursor-agent/v1/meta-data/turn/model`
  If you selected Auto, this is the concrete model that served, not `Auto`. See
  https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/metadata
- Outside a managed VM, pass the `model.id` used at create/launch if you still
  have that record.
- If the key is missing (`404` / empty), omit `model` so the export posts
  `Model pending` — do **not** invent one.

**Deployed pages (when the work actually shipped UI/routes):**

- If merge+deploy produced live pages people can click, put those URLs in
  `extras` as Discord markdown links (one per line item). Prefer the specific
  routes/pages that changed, not only the site root.
- Skip this when nothing user-visible deployed (library-only, docs-only with no
  hosted page, parked/blocked, or deploy not reached).
- Do **not** invent URLs. Only include pages you verified or that the deploy
  output / PR preview / production URL clearly maps to.

```javascript
import sendShippedPr from 'kody:@kentcdodds/discord/send-shipped-pr'

export default async function main() {
	return sendShippedPr({
		agentId: 'bc-…', // metadata socket or launch URL
		model: 'grok-4.6', // metadata turn/model (deterministic)
		title: 'OpenAPI spec fetches now count against daily quota',
		difficulty: 'Medium',
		status: 'Shipped', // or Parked / Blocked
		summary: 'One-screen what shipped and why it is done.',
		prUrl: 'https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123',
		repo: 'owner/repo',
		extras: [
			'CI green',
			'[Account](https://kody.codes/account)', // only when that page actually deployed
			'[Connect](https://kody.codes/connect)',
		],
	})
}
```
