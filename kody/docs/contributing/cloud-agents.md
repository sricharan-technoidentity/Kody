# Cursor Cloud Agent notes

Kody runs on Cloudflare Workers: the origin app/MCP worker plus platform,
runtime, jobs, and status workers (Remix 3 UI + OAuth-protected MCP). See
[`local development`](./setup/local-development.md) for the local dev guide;
this document covers Cloud Agent VM gotchas only.

## Node 26

The repo requires Node **>=26** (`engines` in root `package.json`). Cloud Agent
VMs may ship Node 22 at `/exec-daemon/node`, which takes precedence over nvm
unless nvm’s Node 26 bin directory is prepended to `PATH`. Verify with
`node --version` before running scripts.

## Playwright browsers

Playwright's Chromium (used by `npm run test:e2e:run` / `validate`) is
pre-installed in `~/.cache/ms-playwright` and persists in the VM snapshot, so
normally nothing extra is needed. The **non-obvious gotcha**:
`playwright install` (and `test:e2e:install` / `test:e2e:ensure`) **hangs** on
this VM kernel — its Node-based zip extractor stalls on an `io_uring` write
partway through (around `libwidevinecdm.so`), and `UV_USE_IO_URING=0` does not
stop it. The browser zip downloads fine; only the built-in extraction hangs.

If browsers are ever missing (e.g. a Playwright version bump changes the
revision), do **not** rely on `playwright install`. Run
`npm run test:e2e:ensure`: on Cloud Agent Linux it downloads the `browsers.json`
revision and extracts with native `unzip`
(`tools/install-playwright-browsers-unzip.ts`). Other machines still use
`playwright install` (with `--with-deps` locally). A Cloud Agent snapshot
install should run `test:e2e:ensure` after `npm install` so a Playwright bump
does not leave stale `chromium-1208` markers. To do the same steps by hand:

1. Get the revision + Chrome-for-Testing version from
   `node_modules/playwright-core/browsers.json` and the CDN URL printed by
   `npx playwright install chromium` (form:
   `https://cdn.playwright.dev/builds/cft/<cft-version>/linux64/chrome-linux64.zip`
   and `.../chrome-headless-shell-linux64.zip`).
2. `curl -fsSL -o /tmp/c.zip <chrome-linux64.zip>` then
   `unzip -q /tmp/c.zip -d ~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-<rev>/`.
3. Repeat for the headless shell into
   `~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-<rev>/` (Playwright launches
   headless via the separate headless-shell binary, so both are required).
4. `chmod +x` the `chrome` and `chrome-headless-shell` binaries, then
   `touch INSTALLATION_COMPLETE` in each revision directory.

`control-kody doctor` reads the `chromium` and `chromium-headless-shell`
revisions from `node_modules/playwright-core/browsers.json`. It passes only when
both `~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-<rev>/INSTALLATION_COMPLETE` and
`chromium_headless_shell-<rev>/INSTALLATION_COMPLETE` exist. A marker from
another revision fails, and the failure prints the unzip steps for that
revision.

## Nx remote cache

Validate and `test:push` write Nx task artifacts. Those stay local unless the
self-hosted cache is configured. To populate GitHub Actions hits, set both on
the Cloud **environment** (not a one-off `export`). Use the write token
(`NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_ACCESS_TOKEN`). Same-repo Actions validate uses
that token too; only fork `pull_request` jobs use the read token:

```bash
export NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_SERVER=https://nx-cache.kody.codes
export NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_ACCESS_TOKEN="$NX_CACHE_WRITE_TOKEN"
```

Use `CI=1` on cached test commands (the repo scripts already do). Leave the
variables unset to run without remote cache. Those scripts run through
`tools/run-nx.ts` so a mid-run `/v1/cache` transport flake cannot fail
`test:push` or validate after the tasks already succeeded. See
[`packages/nx-cache/readme.md`](../packages/nx-cache/readme.md).

## Playwright E2E

Playwright E2E stays out of quick gates: that suite is heavier than the unit
gate. Bundler artifacts live under `src/node_modules/.kody-generated/` and
wrangler-env clears that collector's additional-module watches and disables
esbuild's source-graph watcher in `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=test`
(`WRANGLER_DISABLE_BUNDLE_WATCH`) so `wrangler dev` does not loop on overlay
create events. Run `npm run test:e2e:run` or `npm run validate` for the
Playwright gate locally. `wrangler-env.ts` defaults `X_LOCAL_EXPLORER=false` on
`dev` because wrangler 4.127+ local explorer writes under `.wrangler/tmp` on
these VMs, retriggers esbuild, and leaves ProxyWorker in a pause/reload loop
after Ready. Opt in with `X_LOCAL_EXPLORER=true`. Wrangler 4.131+ keeps
`Error inside ProxyWorker` request-scoped (workers-sdk#15252), so a transient
ProxyWorker failure no longer exits the Playwright webServer.

## Dependency install

Cloud Agent environment setup and local setup both run `npm install`. CI runs
`npm ci`. `npm install` keeps `package-lock.json` unchanged when every locked
direct dependency satisfies the peer ranges its declared range can still reach,
including optional peers. `npm run lockfile:check` (part of `npm run validate`
and the CI static job) rejects a lockfile `npm install` would rewrite, such as
an `@cloudflare/workers-types` pin older than wrangler's peer range.

## GitHub CLI

Cloud Agent `gh` can read issues, PRs, and checks. It cannot post PR
review-thread replies (`403`). Reply with `kody:@kentcdodds/github/request`
(kody-bot) or Cursor `ManagePullRequest` `post_comment` / `in_reply_to`. See
[ship-pr](../../.agents/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md).

## Dev server

- `npm run dev:ensure` is the agent entry point. It probes origin `/health` on
  3742–3751, prints `App running at http://localhost:<port>` and exits 0 when a
  server is already up, waits for a kody/workerd leftover that accepts TCP but
  does not serve `/health` before replacing it, then starts `npm run dev` and
  waits until `/health` is actually ok before printing the resolved URL. If
  `packages/worker/.env` is missing, it copies `.env.example` first so
  `npm run dev` (`--env-file=packages/worker/.env`) can start. If wrangler
  accepts TCP but Remix logs `Invalid environment variables` /
  `Missing APP_DB binding` (or the same for `BUNDLE_ARTIFACTS_KV`,
  `STORAGE_RUNNER`, `PACKAGE_REALTIME_SESSION`, `MCP_CLIENT_HUB`), `dev:ensure`
  exits immediately with that hint instead of waiting 180s. Those bindings come
  from `wrangler.jsonc` via the Vite Cloudflare plugin, not from `.env`; a
  snapshot that cannot provide local D1/KV/DO persist cannot serve `/` or
  `/blog/*`. If the latest wrangler line is Reloading and `/health` still misses
  the budget, the process is left running so a retry can reuse it. UI
  verification opens that real origin (for example `/onboarding`); do not
  substitute a `renderToString` dump of one component.
- `npm run dev` starts the optional Cloudflare API mock, then Vite so origin SSR
  and the client hydrate in one workerd graph. Generated platform and runtime
  configs join as Vite auxiliary workers, with the committed jobs and highlight
  configs (local D1/KV/DO persistence). Non-TTY sessions print `App running at`
  only after `/health` responds.
- Default worker port is **3742** (`cli.ts`); the CLI picks a free port when
  3742 is taken and prints `App running at http://localhost:<port>`.
- Run long-lived interactive `npm run dev` in tmux so the session survives tool
  timeouts. `dev:ensure` detaches the started process so the ensure command can
  exit.
- Health check (no auth): `curl http://localhost:<port>/health` →
  `{"ok":true,"commitSha":...,"commit":...,"pullRequest":...,"deploy":...}`.
  Locally the extra fields are `null` unless a deploy var is set. Platform and
  runtime health paths (`/__platform/health`, `/__runtime/health`) 404 on the
  origin port.

## Environment file

Copy `packages/worker/.env.example` to `packages/worker/.env` if missing.
`dev:ensure` and `migrate:local` do this copy themselves. `COOKIE_SECRET` and
`SECRET_STORE_KEY` are required for local dev. The file does not create D1, KV,
or Durable Object bindings.

## Seeding a test account

After `npm run migrate:local`, seed the local fixture logins per
[`seeding`](./setup/seeding.md): `kody@example.com` / `ilikecode` (seeded with
the `admin` role) and `jane@example.com` / `ilikecode` (regular account). These
credentials are local test fixtures only. The seed script resolves the worker
Wrangler config automatically (same default as `wrangler-env.ts`), so
`node tools/seed-test-data.ts --local` works without extra flags. Migrate and
seed write D1 under `.wrangler/state`, the directory Vite persists.

## Local limitations

- Vectorize bindings are not emulated locally; capability search uses the
  offline ranker when `WRANGLER_IS_LOCAL_DEV` is set (normal for `npm run dev`).
- `/mcp` returns **401** without OAuth; use browser login or MCP E2E tests for
  authenticated MCP checks.
