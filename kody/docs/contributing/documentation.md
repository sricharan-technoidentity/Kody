# Documentation

This repository maintains two audiences:

- **[`docs/use/`](../use/index.md)** — People who connect an agent to Kody over
  MCP. Progressive disclosure: short pages linked from the usage index.
- **`docs/contributing/`** — People who develop Kody (code, kody, infra).

## Principles

**Describe how things work.** Write in the present tense. Avoid changelog-style
phrases (“now we…”, “we no longer…”, “previously…”) in both usage and
contributing docs; those belong in commit messages or release notes. Describe
the system as it works today (“Kody stores…”, “The manifest rejects…”) instead
of narrating a rollout (“Kody now stores…”, “We no longer accept…”).

`npm run docs:check-temporal` checks durable documentation and docs-like MCP
instructions for common rollout phrases. `npm run docs:check-decisions` rejects
duplicate decision-record numbers. `npm run mermaid:check` parses fenced mermaid
in docs and agent skills (and `--stdin` recap blocks) so GitHub's "Unable to
render rich display" failures fail locally. `npm run slop-ratchet:check` holds
the client-route and node-test file-size allowlists and rejects decorative
`========` / `----------` comment banners. `kody-custom/no-tautological-absence`
rejects vanished-copy `not.toContain` leftovers in tests during `npm run lint`.
`npm run knip` fails on unused files, exports, and types against the configured
entrypoints. `kody-custom/no-oversized-guide-section` rejects official guide
headings that exceed the search response budget. These run as part of
`npm run validate`.

Docs-like product copy follows the same rule: MCP server instructions, tool and
schema descriptions, and user-visible UI strings should not read like release
notes.

**Exceptions.** Migration and rotation guides (for example
[`secret-rotation.md`](./secret-rotation.md)) may use ordered steps across
deploy phases, [decision records](./decisions/index.md) are a point-in-time
steering veto list by design, and dated reviews under
[`docs/audits/`](../audits/) are point-in-time snapshots. Outside those
procedures, still describe the current design in plain language. Quoted
validation errors and runtime messages should match what the product returns,
even when the wording contrasts with older manifest shapes.

**Stay lightweight but valuable.** Prefer small, accurate pages over large stale
ones. **Garden** docs when behavior changes: update or delete sections in the
same change as the code when possible. Remove duplication between pages by
linking out instead of copying paragraphs. When a contributing guide grows past
a single topic, turn it into a directory with a short `index.md` and one file
per topic so agents load only what they need (see [`setup/`](./setup/index.md)).

**Prefer a checker over a should-list.** Constraints that lint, TypeScript, or
`npm run validate` can reject belong in those tools. Contributing docs describe
how the system works and point at the check. They do not ask agents or humans to
remember a rule the repo can enforce. When a pattern needs control-flow or
interprocedural reasoning a cheap checker cannot do, describe the failure mode
and stop — do not add a noisy half-rule. See
[harness engineering](./harness-engineering.md) (promote into enforcement) and
[oxlint JS plugins](./oxlint-js-plugins.md).

**MCP instructions and tool descriptions stay tight.** Server-level instructions
and per-tool descriptions should give the model what it needs **before**
choosing or invoking a tool: workflows, constraints, and **copy-pasteable
examples**. Long policy lists and exhaustive field semantics belong in **usage
docs** or in **tool responses** (structured content, error text, and follow-up
messages), not in the instruction string.

**Put post-call detail in the call result.** Anything the model only needs
**after** a tool runs (full schemas on demand, ranked hit lists, approval URLs,
error bodies) should surface from the **tool response**, not from static
instructions. Static text should not repeat large chunks of what the user or
model will see in the next response.

**Avoid overlap with generated surfaces.** If the MCP host already shows tool
schemas or resource listings, documentation and instructions should not restate
the same tables verbatim; link to usage docs or rely on the tool output.
