# Testing principles

This codebase favors small, readable test suites with explicit setup and minimal
magic. Individual tests should follow a meaningful workflow end-to-end, even
when that makes a single test longer and more assertion-heavy.

## Test flavor decision matrix

Choose the lightest flavor that can falsify the behavior. Filename suffixes pick
the Vitest project (`vitest.config.ts`):

| Flavor / command                                                                    | Use when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Avoid when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**Usage metering example** (lifted from
[usage metering](./architecture/usage-metering.md)): in `*.node.test.ts`, spy on
`recordUsage` and assert call shape for success and failure paths. In
`*.workers.test.ts` with a real local D1, call `ensureUsageRollupsTestSchema`
from `packages/worker/src/usage/test-schema.ts` and assert on `usage_rollups`
rows instead of spying.

Shared test helpers live under `packages/worker/src/test-support/`. Import
factories explicitly inside each test (or a per-test factory). Do not introduce
`beforeEach` hooks that hide setup — that conflicts with the principles below.

## Principles

- Prefer the "fewer, longer tests" style from Kent C. Dodds when assertions
  belong to one workflow.
- Treat each test like a manual tester's script: one setup, then as many actions
  and assertions as needed to validate the whole journey.
- Do not split a single flow into many tiny tests just to satisfy "one assertion
  per test." Multiple related assertions in one test are a feature, not a smell.
- Prefer flat test files: use top-level `test(...)` and avoid `describe`
  nesting.
- Avoid shared setup like `beforeEach`/`afterEach`; inline setup per test.
- Avoid shared mutable test state across cases. If the next assertion depends on
  the same rendered object, request, or response, it likely belongs in the same
  test.
- Do not add tautological assertions. An assertion is tautological when it
  cannot fail unless the implementation and the test change in lockstep — there
  is no independent oracle. Typical forms:
  - Identity predicates: `isFoo(FOO_CONSTANT)` when `isFoo` is `===`,
    `includes`, or `Set.has` of that same constant. Keep the interesting
    branches (normalization, prefix/suffix, negatives, Error wrapping, cause
    chains).
  - Constant-to-self pins: `expect(EXPORTED_DAYS).toBe(14)` or
    `expect(exportedDelays).toEqual([100, 500, 1_500])`. If the value is a
    public contract, assert it where a caller observes it (serialized payload,
    HTTP body, retry `nextDelayMs`), not on the export itself.
  - Algorithm echo: building `expected` with the same helper the production
    function uses (`shellQuote(x)` on both sides; picking the same fields
    `toSummary(post)` returns). Use an independent oracle (hardcoded quoted
    string, live schema after migration).
  - Self-equality: `equal(x, x)`. Type-only checks, instructional-copy pins, and
    a lone "q is not there" after a deletion (later bullets) are the same
    failure mode. Identity predicates and algorithm echo stay a review item;
    vanished-copy `not.toContain` is `kody-custom/no-tautological-absence`.
- Don't write tests for what the type system already guarantees.
- Use disposable objects only when there is real cleanup. If no cleanup, skip
  `using` and `Symbol.dispose`.
- Build helpers that return ready-to-run objects (factory pattern), not globals.
- Keep test intent obvious in the name: "auth handler returns 400 for invalid
  JSON".
- Write tests so they could run offline if necessary: avoid relying on the
  public internet and third-party services; prefer local fakes/fixtures.
- Keep the bar for adding tests high, especially slower integration and E2E
  tests.
- Prefer fast unit tests for server logic; keep e2e tests focused on a very
  small number of important happy-path journeys.
- Treat `packages/worker/src/mcp/*.mcp-e2e.test.ts` as a tiny MCP transport
  smoke suite. Do not add capability-specific cases there unless they require
  the real MCP HTTP transport, OAuth flow, and package-app session wiring.
- Prefer asserting intermediate states inside the broader workflow that causes
  them rather than adding isolated tests that only check an incidental loading
  or transition state.
- Do not add regression tests for bugs that are unlikely to happen again unless
  the flow is important enough to justify the maintenance cost.
- Avoid tests that only assert a string blob contains a description or other
  incidental copy. Favor behavior-focused assertions (structured output,
  user-visible outcomes, or stable public contracts) instead. When a blog
  catalog pin must quote an approved sentence, run the source through
  `normalizeMarkdownPhraseSource` in
  [`packages/worker/src/blog/catalog.ts`](../../packages/worker/src/blog/catalog.ts)
  first. oxfmt reflows markdown blockquotes onto continuation `>` lines, so a
  raw `post.body.includes('exact phrase')` fails after format even though the
  words are still there.
- Do not add tests whose only value is pinning configuration-style strings such
  as tool descriptions, usage hints, warnings, or other instructional copy. If
  the behavior matters, test the behavior or stable structured contract rather
  than asserting that specific prose appears.
- Keep absence assertions that flip state. "x is there, z is not; click y; now x
  is gone and z is there" is useful. A lone "q is not there" after q was deleted
  is not. That only fails if someone pastes the old name back. Fine to use
  locally while deleting; do not commit it. Same for old class names, filenames,
  aria-labels, CSS selectors, retired capability ids, and deleted table names on
  a static inventory list. Absence is still a good assertion when a live path
  could show the thing: loading vs ready, empty vs populated, secret vs
  redacted, admin vs user, or generated SQL vs a table the generator could still
  emit. `kody-custom/no-tautological-absence` (`npm run lint`) rejects
  instructional-copy `not.toContain('…')` when that string exists only as the
  absence assertion (state flips, fixtures, live production copy, and
  wrong-template siblings still pass).
- Run server/unit tests with `npm run test` (plus targeted Vitest paths when
  needed) to avoid Playwright spec discovery and accidental matches like
  `packages/worker/src/mcp/mcp-server.mcp-e2e.test.ts`.
- Workers-unit harness rules (see
  [decision 0011](./decisions/0011-workers-unit-pool-harness.md)):
  - **Prefer `*.node.test.ts`** unless the assertion needs real Cloudflare
    bindings or Workers-only APIs (`@cloudflare/worker-bundler`, DO RPC, etc.).
  - **Do not** warm Durable Objects from `globalSetup` (Node-only) or from
    workers-unit `setupFiles` (breaks webhook / scheduled / `packageSave`
    suites).
  - **Do not** use `--no-isolate` / shared storage to chase suite wall clock.
    Per-file isolation stays; disabling it breaks suites that assume a clean
    store.
  - **Do not** stub away DOs in workers tests when binding fidelity is the
    point, and do not “fix” pool slowness with `--no-verify` or a shorter local
    `testTimeout`. Shared `testTimeout` is 20s so the pool’s ~10s first DO RPC
    in a file does not fail the default budget.
  - Pool cold load is inherent today; suite wall clock will not match production
    RPC latency until the upstream pool improves.
- Vitest is configured with `clearMocks` and `mockReset` globally
  (`vitest-shared.ts`). Each test starts with a clean mock slate; inline the
  setup a test needs rather than relying on leftover state from a prior case.
  Keep explicit mid-test resets only when one workflow test runs multiple
  scenarios in a single `test(...)`.
- Console output is guarded globally
  (`packages/worker/src/test-support/console-spies.ts`, wired via `setupFiles`):
  unexpected `console.error`/`console.warn` calls fail the test, and
  `console.info`/`console.debug` are silenced. Never silence blindly — a blanket
  `.mockImplementation(() => {})` can hide a real regression. Instead:
  - When the log is part of the tested contract, import the exported
    `consoleError`/`consoleWarn` spies, call `.mockImplementation(() => {})`,
    and assert on the calls (prefer the stable first-argument tag plus
    `expect.any(Error)`; do not pin long prose). Assert the call count too when
    it is deterministic.
  - When the log is incidental to the behavior under test, use
    `silenceExpectedConsoleWarns([...])` / `silenceExpectedConsoleErrors([...])`
    (same module) with the exact expected message tags, or
    `silenceIncidentalRuntimeWarnings()`
    (`packages/worker/src/test-support/incidental-runtime-warnings.ts`) for the
    bundler/registry-runtime noise set. Anything outside the allowlist still
    fails the test.
  - Workerd logs Durable Object / WorkerEntrypoint RPC rejections as
    `uncaught exception` even when the caller catches them. Do not filter those
    dumps — a real isolate crash must stay visible. Prevent the RPC throw
    instead: fail closed in the sandbox or host tool before the gateway/DO call
    (retriever `fetch`, read-only `storage.sql`), and when a test must exercise
    an in-object abort, call the method inside `runInDurableObject` rather than
    across the test RPC stub.

  Keep test output free of stray logging.

- The audit-log sink is mocked globally for `node-unit` tests
  (`packages/worker/src/test-support/audit-log-spy.ts`, wired via the project's
  `setupFiles`): import `logAuditEventSpy` and assert the audit events a handler
  is expected to emit (and `not.toHaveBeenCalled()` where none are). Tests that
  exercise the real audit pipeline opt out with
  `vi.unmock('#worker/audit-log.ts')`; tests that need to override other exports
  (e.g. `getRequestIp`) declare their own `vi.mock('#worker/audit-log.ts', ...)`
  and route `logAuditEvent` back through the shared spy.

## Examples

### Tautological assertions

```ts
// Bad — matcher is `normalized === THE_CONSTANT`
expect(isResetMessage(resetMessageConstant)).toBe(true)
expect(exportedRetryDelaysMs).toEqual([100, 500, 1_500])
expect(windowsEqual(window, window)).toBe(true)

// Good — independent oracle or a real branch
expect(isResetMessage(resetMessageConstant.replace(/\.$/, ''))).toBe(true)
expect(retries).toEqual([{ attempt: 1, nextDelayMs: 100 }])
expect(windowsEqual(window, { ...window, end: window.end + 1 })).toBe(false)
```

### Absence assertions

```ts
// Bad — q is gone; nothing can show it again
expect(capabilityMap.old_write).toBeUndefined()
expect(html).not.toContain('old-aria-label')

// Good — state flip: present on one path, absent on the other
expect(adminMap.adminUserList).toBeTruthy()
expect(userMap.adminUserList).toBeUndefined()
```

### `Symbol.dispose` with `using`

```ts
import { writeFile, readFile, rm } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { test, expect } from 'vitest'

const createTempFile = async () => {
	const path = `/tmp/test-${crypto.randomUUID()}.txt`
	await writeFile(path, 'hello')

	return {
		path,
		[Symbol.asyncDispose]: async () => {
			await rm(path, { force: true }).catch(() => {
				// Cleanup should never fail the test.
			})
		},
	}
}

test('reads a temp file', async () => {
	await using tempFile = await createTempFile()
	const contents = await readFile(tempFile.path, 'utf8')
	expect(contents).toBe('hello')
})
```

### `Symbol.asyncDispose` with `await using`

```ts
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { test, expect } from 'vitest'

const createDisposableServer = async () => {
	const server = createServer((_request, response) => {
		response.end('ok')
	})
	await new Promise<void>((resolve) => server.listen(0, resolve))
	const address = server.address()
	if (!address || typeof address === 'string') {
		throw new Error('Failed to resolve test server port')
	}

	return {
		url: `http://localhost:${address.port}`,
		[Symbol.asyncDispose]: async () => {
			await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
				server.close((error) => {
					if (error) reject(error)
					else resolve()
				})
			})
		},
	}
}

test('fetches from a disposable server', async () => {
	await using server = await createDisposableServer()
	const response = await fetch(server.url)
	expect(await response.text()).toBe('ok')
})
```
