# Testing principles

This codebase favors small, readable test suites with explicit setup and minimal
magic. Individual tests should follow a meaningful workflow end-to-end, even
when that makes a single test longer and more assertion-heavy.

## Test flavor decision matrix

Choose the lightest flavor that can falsify the behavior. Filename suffixes pick
the Vitest project (`vitest.config.ts`):

| Flavor / command                         | Use when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Avoid when                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*.node.test.ts` (`npm run test:node`)   | Server logic, handlers and adapters. Use `createTestDb({ userId })` for the migrated PostgreSQL baseline and scoped writer/reader, or `createTargetTestEnv()` for the complete mock AWS/Temporal environment. Use native workerd Runner tests for published package compatibility. | In-process fakes cannot prove sandbox compatibility or HTTP/browser transport behavior. |
| `*.mcp-e2e.test.ts` (`npm run test:mcp`) | A small suite for native Node MCP transport, OAuth and package-app session wiring.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Capability coverage that a node test can exercise.                                      |
| Playwright (`npm run test:e2e:run`)      | The selected POC browser journeys through the native front door and client. See [end-to-end testing](./end-to-end-testing.md).                                                                                                                                                     | Edge cases and behavior covered by faster tests.                                        |

The migration POC no longer runs a Workers test pool. The retained legacy SQLite
fixtures are pending P8 conversion; new application tests use PGlite.
`database.pg` is reserved for fixture seeding and raw assertions. Execute the
behavior under test through `database.db`, `database.reader` or an explicit
operator role. Owner tests must not use a superuser to bypass RLS. Dispose
fixtures with `await using` or their explicit `close()` method.

For usage metering, spy on `recordUsage` when the call shape is the contract.
Use an owner-scoped PostgreSQL fixture when the persisted rollup is the
contract. Temporal workflow/activity tests use a standalone local test server;
AWS adapters use mock credentials and in-memory service doubles.

Shared test helpers live under `packages/worker/src/test-support/`. Import
factories explicitly inside each test (or a per-test factory). Do not introduce
`beforeEach` hooks that hide setup — that conflicts with the principles below.

## Principles

- Prefer the "fewer, longer tests" style from Kent C. Dodds when assertions
  belong to one workflow.
- Treat each test like a manual tester's script: one setup, then as many actions
  and assertions as needed to validate the whole journey.
- Do not split a single flow into many tiny tests just to satisfy "one assertion
  per test." Multiple related assertions in one test are a feature, not a smell.
- Prefer flat test files: use top-level `test(...)` and avoid `describe`
  nesting.
- Avoid shared setup like `beforeEach`/`afterEach`; inline setup per test.
- Avoid shared mutable test state across cases. If the next assertion depends on
  the same rendered object, request, or response, it likely belongs in the same
  test.
- Do not add tautological assertions. An assertion is tautological when it
  cannot fail unless the implementation and the test change in lockstep — there
  is no independent oracle. Typical forms:
  - Identity predicates: `isFoo(FOO_CONSTANT)` when `isFoo` is `===`,
    `includes`, or `Set.has` of that same constant. Keep the interesting
    branches (normalization, prefix/suffix, negatives, Error wrapping, cause
    chains).
  - Constant-to-self pins: `expect(EXPORTED_DAYS).toBe(14)` or
    `expect(exportedDelays).toEqual([100, 500, 1_500])`. If the value is a
    public contract, assert it where a caller observes it (serialized payload,
    HTTP body, retry `nextDelayMs`), not on the export itself.
  - Algorithm echo: building `expected` with the same helper the production
    function uses (`shellQuote(x)` on both sides; picking the same fields
    `toSummary(post)` returns). Use an independent oracle (hardcoded quoted
    string, live schema after migration).
  - Self-equality: `equal(x, x)`. Type-only checks, instructional-copy pins, and
    a lone "q is not there" after a deletion (later bullets) are the same
    failure mode. Identity predicates and algorithm echo stay a review item;
    vanished-copy `not.toContain` is `kody-custom/no-tautological-absence`.
- Don't write tests for what the type system already guarantees.
- Use disposable objects only when there is real cleanup. If no cleanup, skip
  `using` and `Symbol.dispose`.
- Build helpers that return ready-to-run objects (factory pattern), not globals.
- Keep test intent obvious in the name: "auth handler returns 400 for invalid
  JSON".
- Write tests so they could run offline if necessary: avoid relying on the
  public internet and third-party services; prefer local fakes/fixtures.
- Keep the bar for adding tests high, especially slower integration and E2E
  tests.
- Prefer fast unit tests for server logic; keep e2e tests focused on a very
  small number of important happy-path journeys.
- Treat `packages/worker/src/mcp/*.mcp-e2e.test.ts` as a tiny MCP transport
  smoke suite. Do not add capability-specific cases there unless they require
  the real MCP HTTP transport, OAuth flow, and package-app session wiring.
- Prefer asserting intermediate states inside the broader workflow that causes
  them rather than adding isolated tests that only check an incidental loading
  or transition state.
- Do not add regression tests for bugs that are unlikely to happen again unless
  the flow is important enough to justify the maintenance cost.
- Avoid tests that only assert a string blob contains a description or other
  incidental copy. Favor behavior-focused assertions (structured output,
  user-visible outcomes, or stable public contracts) instead. When a blog
  catalog pin must quote an approved sentence, run the source through
  `normalizeMarkdownPhraseSource` in
  [`packages/worker/src/blog/catalog.ts`](../../packages/worker/src/blog/catalog.ts)
  first. oxfmt reflows markdown blockquotes onto continuation `>` lines, so a
  raw `post.body.includes('exact phrase')` fails after format even though the
  words are still there.
- Do not add tests whose only value is pinning configuration-style strings such
  as tool descriptions, usage hints, warnings, or other instructional copy. If
  the behavior matters, test the behavior or stable structured contract rather
  than asserting that specific prose appears.
- Keep absence assertions that flip state. "x is there, z is not; click y; now x
  is gone and z is there" is useful. A lone "q is not there" after q was deleted
  is not. That only fails if someone pastes the old name back. Fine to use
  locally while deleting; do not commit it. Same for old class names, filenames,
  aria-labels, CSS selectors, retired capability ids, and deleted table names on
  a static inventory list. Absence is still a good assertion when a live path
  could show the thing: loading vs ready, empty vs populated, secret vs
  redacted, admin vs user, or generated SQL vs a table the generator could still
  emit. `kody-custom/no-tautological-absence` (`npm run lint`) rejects
  instructional-copy `not.toContain('…')` when that string exists only as the
  absence assertion (state flips, fixtures, live production copy, and
  wrong-template siblings still pass).
- Run server/unit tests with `npm run test` (plus targeted Vitest paths when
  needed) to avoid Playwright spec discovery and accidental matches like
  `packages/worker/src/mcp/mcp-server.mcp-e2e.test.ts`.
- Keep per-file isolation for Node, PGlite, Temporal and Runner tests. Native
  workerd compatibility tests run through the Runner harness; an in-process fake
  alone does not establish that published packages run unchanged.
- Vitest is configured with `clearMocks` and `mockReset` globally
  (`vitest-shared.ts`). Each test starts with a clean mock slate; inline the
  setup a test needs rather than relying on leftover state from a prior case.
  Keep explicit mid-test resets only when one workflow test runs multiple
  scenarios in a single `test(...)`.
- Console output is guarded globally
  (`packages/worker/src/test-support/console-spies.ts`, wired via `setupFiles`):
  unexpected `console.error`/`console.warn` calls fail the test, and
  `console.info`/`console.debug` are silenced. Never silence blindly — a blanket
  `.mockImplementation(() => {})` can hide a real regression. Instead:
  - When the log is part of the tested contract, import the exported
    `consoleError`/`consoleWarn` spies, call `.mockImplementation(() => {})`,
    and assert on the calls (prefer the stable first-argument tag plus
    `expect.any(Error)`; do not pin long prose). Assert the call count too when
    it is deterministic.
  - When the log is incidental to the behavior under test, use
    `silenceExpectedConsoleWarns([...])` / `silenceExpectedConsoleErrors([...])`
    (same module) with the exact expected message tags, or
    `silenceIncidentalRuntimeWarnings()`
    (`packages/worker/src/test-support/incidental-runtime-warnings.ts`) for the
    bundler/registry-runtime noise set. Anything outside the allowlist still
    fails the test.
  - Keep native workerd isolate failures visible. When the host can reject an
    invalid request before entering the sandbox, assert that rejection through
    the Runner/broker harness. Do not filter isolate crash dumps to obtain a
    passing test.

  Keep test output free of stray logging.

- The audit-log sink is mocked globally for `node-unit` tests
  (`packages/worker/src/test-support/audit-log-spy.ts`, wired via the project's
  `setupFiles`): import `logAuditEventSpy` and assert the audit events a handler
  is expected to emit (and `not.toHaveBeenCalled()` where none are). Tests that
  exercise the real audit pipeline opt out with
  `vi.unmock('#worker/audit-log.ts')`; tests that need to override other exports
  (e.g. `getRequestIp`) declare their own `vi.mock('#worker/audit-log.ts', ...)`
  and route `logAuditEvent` back through the shared spy.

## Examples

### Tautological assertions

```ts
// Bad — matcher is `normalized === THE_CONSTANT`
expect(isResetMessage(resetMessageConstant)).toBe(true)
expect(exportedRetryDelaysMs).toEqual([100, 500, 1_500])
expect(windowsEqual(window, window)).toBe(true)

// Good — independent oracle or a real branch
expect(isResetMessage(resetMessageConstant.replace(/\.$/, ''))).toBe(true)
expect(retries).toEqual([{ attempt: 1, nextDelayMs: 100 }])
expect(windowsEqual(window, { ...window, end: window.end + 1 })).toBe(false)
```

### Absence assertions

```ts
// Bad — q is gone; nothing can show it again
expect(capabilityMap.old_write).toBeUndefined()
expect(html).not.toContain('old-aria-label')

// Good — state flip: present on one path, absent on the other
expect(adminMap.adminUserList).toBeTruthy()
expect(userMap.adminUserList).toBeUndefined()
```

### `Symbol.dispose` with `using`

```ts
import { writeFile, readFile, rm } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { test, expect } from 'vitest'

const createTempFile = async () => {
	const path = `/tmp/test-${crypto.randomUUID()}.txt`
	await writeFile(path, 'hello')

	return {
		path,
		[Symbol.asyncDispose]: async () => {
			await rm(path, { force: true }).catch(() => {
				// Cleanup should never fail the test.
			})
		},
	}
}

test('reads a temp file', async () => {
	await using tempFile = await createTempFile()
	const contents = await readFile(tempFile.path, 'utf8')
	expect(contents).toBe('hello')
})
```

### `Symbol.asyncDispose` with `await using`

```ts
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { test, expect } from 'vitest'

const createDisposableServer = async () => {
	const server = createServer((_request, response) => {
		response.end('ok')
	})
	await new Promise<void>((resolve) => server.listen(0, resolve))
	const address = server.address()
	if (!address || typeof address === 'string') {
		throw new Error('Failed to resolve test server port')
	}

	return {
		url: `http://localhost:${address.port}`,
		[Symbol.asyncDispose]: async () => {
			await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
				server.close((error) => {
					if (error) reject(error)
					else resolve()
				})
			})
		},
	}
}

test('fetches from a disposable server', async () => {
	await using server = await createDisposableServer()
	const response = await fetch(server.url)
	expect(await response.text()).toBe('ok')
})
```
