# Checks

Husky hooks, `npm run validate`, and the test commands that gate commits and
pushes. See the [setup index](./index.md) for the other setup pages.

- `git commit` runs the Husky `pre-commit` hook, which formats staged
  JavaScript/TypeScript/JSON/Markdown/CSS files with `oxfmt`, applies
  `oxlint --fix` to staged JavaScript/TypeScript files, runs `npm run typecheck`
  for the repo, and runs `npm run migrations:check` before the commit is
  created.
- `git push` runs the Husky `pre-push` hook, which executes `npm run test:push`
  (`CI=1` `test:node` + `test:workers`) so pushes are blocked when those suites
  fail. Those are the same Nx targets the CI Node / Workers jobs run, so a
  remote-cache hit is possible after push. Playwright E2E stays in
  `npm run validate` and the CI E2E job. The push hook stops short of that suite
  because Playwright E2E is heavier than the unit gate, and a failed e2e leg
  skips the unit gate when the push is retried with `--no-verify`. Bundler
  artifacts live under `src/node_modules/.kody-generated/`. Local origin
  development uses Vite; `wrangler-env.ts` still wraps D1/types and sibling
  worker deploys. Playwright sets `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=test` so Vite skips
  platform/runtime auxiliary workers. Cursor Cloud Agent VMs keep Cursor's hook
  dispatcher as `core.hooksPath` and compose Husky through
  `npm run hooks:ensure` (`prepare` runs it after `husky`; Cloud Agent
  environment `start` should run it too) so `pre-push` still reaches `.husky/_`
  — see [cloud-agents.md](../cloud-agents.md#git-hooks). Vitest's default
  `testTimeout` is 20s so the workers pool's first Durable Object RPC in a file
  (~10s) does not fail the default budget (see
  [decision 0011](../decisions/0011-workers-unit-pool-harness.md)); the push
  gate also sets `CI=1` so worker count and Nx cache hashes match GitHub
  Actions.
- Because the commit hook already enforces formatting, lint fixes, and
  typechecking, agents do not need to run those checks separately before every
  commit unless they want earlier feedback or are validating a larger change set
  before opening a PR.
- Push-time hooks intentionally stop short of `npm run validate`; Playwright
  E2E, MCP E2E, and repo-wide format checks remain explicit checks because they
  are heavier than the push gate.
- `npm run validate` is the single authoritative local gate. It is read-only and
  executes `format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test:node`, `test:workers`,
  Playwright E2E, MCP E2E, `backup:build`, `status:build`, `nx-cache:build`,
  `jobs:build`, `runtime:build`, `platform:build`, `primitives:check`,
  `migrations:check`, `deploy-guardrails:check`, `docs:check-temporal`,
  `docs:check-decisions`, and `mermaid:check` in parallel, reporting every
  failure (sibling checks are not aborted on the first failure, including when
  one of the docs or mermaid checks fails). The unit-test and Playwright legs
  set `CI=1` so timeouts, worker limits, and Nx cache hashes match the contended
  parallel layout used in GitHub Actions. CI runs the same checks as parallel
  jobs (🧹 Static, 🧪 Node, ☁️ Workers, 🔌 MCP, 🎭 E2E, aggregated by ✅
  Validate). If `npm run validate` passes locally, CI will pass. Trusted writers
  (Cloud Agent environments, and same-repo validate) set
  `NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_SERVER` and the write token so Nx uploads task
  artifacts to `https://nx-cache.kody.codes`. Fork `pull_request` validate uses
  the read token and can only GET (see
  [decision 0019](../decisions/0019-self-hosted-nx-remote-cache.md),
  [decision 0038](../decisions/0038-no-nx-cloud-read-write-cache-tokens.md),
  [decision 0040](../decisions/0040-same-repo-writers-may-put-nx-cache.md), and
  [`packages/nx-cache/readme.md`](../../../packages/nx-cache/readme.md)). Those
  cached scripts run through `tools/run-nx.ts` so a mid-run remote-cache
  transport flake cannot fail validate after the tasks already succeeded.
- `npm run typecheck` includes `npm run temporal:validate`, which typechecks the
  Temporal gateway and worker, runs the dedicated Temporal Vitest suite, and
  builds the deterministic workflow bundle.
- `npm run deploy-guardrails:check` protects reviewed Durable Object migration
  history and bindings in both Wrangler configs, requires exact allowlisting for
  class deletion, and rejects destructive Cloudflare CLI operations in
  automatically triggered GitHub Actions jobs.
- `npm run validate:fix` runs `format` + `lint:fix` and is the explicit opt-in
  for mutating auto-fixes. It is never required to pass `validate`.
- `npm run format` applies formatting updates on its own.
- `npm run test:push` runs the same `test:node` and `test:workers` suites
  enforced by the Husky `pre-push` hook and by the CI Node / Workers jobs.
- `npm run test:e2e:run` ensures Playwright Chromium is installed before the
  suite starts, so `npm run validate` self-heals on a fresh machine.
- Use `npm run test:e2e:install` when you want to prefetch Playwright browsers
  ahead of time instead of waiting for the first E2E run. CI caches
  `~/.cache/ms-playwright` and runs `test:e2e:ensure`, so a lockfile-matching
  cache hit skips the download and never runs `apt-get` (`--with-deps` is
  local-only; `apt-get update` can hang the E2E job past the 15-minute timeout).
- `npm run test:e2e:run` runs the Playwright suite through Nx and depends on a
  cached `worker:prepare-e2e-env` target for `.env` bootstrap plus an uncached
  `worker:prepare-playwright` target that checks the local Chromium install.
- `npm run test:mcp` runs MCP server E2E tests and also depends on the cached
  `worker:prepare-e2e-env` target, which writes `packages/worker/.env` from
  `.env.example` when needed and backfills `COOKIE_SECRET` before the test run.
