# Runtime and efficiency

Everything your agent runs in Kody — an ad hoc `execute`, a package export, a
job, a workflow step, a package app request — runs server-side in a Cloudflare
Dynamic Worker isolate, not on your laptop and not inside a chat model. Kody
meters unique Dynamic Worker days so that isolate cost is visible by surface.
This page states that cost model once. Package README and AGENTS.md files do not
repeat it.

## Unique worker days

Cloudflare bills **unique Dynamic Worker isolates** (a worker id) **per UTC
day**. Kody records that unit as the `unique_worker_days` / `dynamic_worker_day`
meter.

- The first use of a given worker id on a UTC day counts once for that user.
- Repeating the same worker id on the same UTC day does not add another day.
- Worker identity follows the acting user plus the **module graph** for that
  run: the same user and published graph reuse one isolate; a different graph or
  a different user is a different isolate.

Each plan includes a monthly unique-worker-day allotment. Public-ladder overage
uses the published unique-worker-day rate on
[Pricing](https://kody.codes/pricing). Account usage (`/account/usage` and
`usageGet`) reports the meter with what counts.

## Surfaces

The same meter is tagged with the surface that minted the isolate:

| Surface                      | Typical mint                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `execute`                    | Ad hoc MCP / capability `execute`            |
| `job`                        | Package-owned scheduled or `jobRunNow` work  |
| `package_export`             | A saved-package export invocation            |
| `workflow`                   | A Temporal-orchestrated package workflow run |
| `subscription`               | A package subscription handler               |
| `app_fetch` / `app_realtime` | A package app HTTP or websocket isolate      |
| `retriever` / `webhook`      | Search retrievers and inbound webhooks       |

Saved packages, jobs, and other durable surfaces reuse a stable isolate when the
published module graph stays the same. Ad hoc `execute` identity follows the
acting user plus the module graph of that execute run. Varying `params` and
`packageContext` reuse that isolate — put args in `params`, not literals in
`code`:

```ts
import { kody } from 'kody:runtime'

// Bad: each distinct literal is another isolate
export default async function main() {
	return await kody.emailSend({ subject: 'Hello', text: 'Hi' })
}

// Good: same graph, vary via params
export default async function main(params) {
	return await kody.emailSend(params)
}
// execute({ code, params: { subject: 'Hello', text: 'Hi' } })
```

## Choosing a surface

Search first, then pick the smallest durable home that matches the work:

- A built-in capability or an existing saved-package export, called from
  `execute` or another package.
- A saved package when the behavior will be reused, scheduled, tested, or
  evolved — see [Package lifecycle](./package-lifecycle.md) and
  [Package authoring](./package-authoring.md).
- A [workflow](../use/workflows.md) for durable multi-step or deferred work.

`execute` is the exploration and composition surface. Durable named behavior
lives in a package so later runs share that package's module graph.
